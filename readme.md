# Double harmonic oscilator dynamics
Harmonic model of the single proton transfer. Key aspects in the dynamics were the constant continuity of both forms with the barrier.
The project consists of two parts: polynomial derivation and calculation of analytical Wigner function.
## TODO
:grey_question: Is it worth it to calculate the expansion for the harmonic model (with Hermite)?

:soon: Read the Umesaki's article and how can we modify the mode frequencies?

:soon: How can the thermal excitations correspond to each of the parameters (in true sim and in the harmonic model)?

:soon: Reoder the polynomial_simulation foler and true_calc folders.

:soon: :soon: Calculation of WDF via (i) Moyal equation (directly) and (ii) through definition indirectly through wavefunction.
