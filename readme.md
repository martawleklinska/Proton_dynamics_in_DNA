# Double harmonic oscilator dynamics
Harmonic model of the single proton transfer. Key aspects in the dynamics were the constant continuity of both forms with the barrier.
The project consists of two parts: polynomial derivation and calculation of analytical Wigner function.
## TODO
Add a 4th order polynomial simulation (Godbeer2015) and double morse (Slocombe2022).
