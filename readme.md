# Double harmonic oscilator dynamics
Harmonic model of the single proton transfer. Key aspects in the dynamics were the constant continuity of both forms with the barrier.
The project consists of two parts: polynomial derivation and calculation of analytical Wigner function.

Transition rate was calculated for different $\omega$ values using the Fermi's golden rule.
It was later compared to transition rate $k_{f}$ calcualted via the Eyring's transition state theory.
## TODO
:soon: Read the Umesaki's article and how can we modify the mode frequencies?

:soon: How can the thermal excitations correspond to each of the parameters (in true sim and in the harmonic model)?


:soon: :soon: Calculation of WDF via (i) Moyal equation (directly) and (ii) through definition indirectly through wavefunction.
