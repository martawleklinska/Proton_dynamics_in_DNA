# Double harmonic oscilator dynamics
Harmonic model of the single proton transfer. Key aspects in the dynamics were the constant continuity of both forms with the barrier.
The project consists of two parts: polynomial derivation and calculation of analytical Wigner function.
## TODO
:heavy_check_mark: Redo the t=0 calculations in the harmonic model (the wavefunctions overlap below the barrier - problem);

:heavy_check_mark: Calculate the probability density for each state in each form (true sim and harmonic model + hermite);

:heavy_check_mark: Calculate the differences from energy levels in the harmonic model and true sim energy levels;

:soon: Add a third case of time dependency :arrow_right: "breathing of the parabolas" - tip of the parabolas to be time dependent;

:heavy_check_mark: $\omega(t) = \omega + A\sin(\Omega t)$, which means $\hbar \Omega = k_{B}T$, thus $\Omega = \frac{k_B T}{\hbar}$ :arrow_right: how does $\Omega$ translate to thermal energy?

:heavy_check_mark: Add time-dependency to potential (true sim) params.

:heavy_check_mark: Calculate the Hermite function expansion of the potential functions.

:grey_question: Is it worth it to calculate the expansion for the harmonic model (with Hermite)?

:soon: :soon Calculation of WDF via (i) Moyal equation (directly) and (ii) through definition indirectly through wavefunction.
